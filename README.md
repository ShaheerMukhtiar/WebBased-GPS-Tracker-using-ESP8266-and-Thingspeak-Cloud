## Hardware Architecture

- **NodeMCU (ESP8266):**  
  Serves as the primary microcontroller for GPS data acquisition and acts as the main controller for edge computing.

- **NEO 6M GPS Module:**  
  Receives signals from satellites and provides current geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). It connects to the NodeMCU via serial communication pins (TX and RX).

- **Lithium Battery (3.7V):**  
  Provides portable power supply for the entire system.

- **Buck Converter:**  
  Manages and regulates the voltage for various components within the system.

- **Onboard Code:**  
  Handles GPS parsing, error detection, and API communication.

## Software Architecture

- **Arduino IDE:**  
  Used for embedded programming, facilitating the integration of the GPS module with NodeMCU. It utilizes libraries like TinyGPS++ and handles communication with ThingSpeak.

- **ThingSpeak Platform:**  
  An IoT analytics platform that provides cloud-based data visualization and storage. It offers API keys for secure HTTP communication between the NodeMCU and the ThingSpeak server.

- **JavaScript & Google Maps API:**  
  Employed to develop a dynamic web dashboard that integrates Google Maps for a visually intuitive representation of the tracked location, allowing for real-time updates and historical data viewing.
